    <p class="body-text">
        Johann Wolfgang Ritter von Kempelen de Pázmánd initially made his name by scamming vast swathes of the European population.
        His chess-playing automaton, known as The Mechanical Turk, was first revealed in 1770 to Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and purported
        to be an invention that could best even the greatest chess minds. It toured Europe and the Americas, and bested Napoleon Bonaparte and
        Benjamin Franklin. The automaton, dressed in Ottoman garb, earned a reputation for playing chess and solving chess puzzles like nothing
        seen before.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Unfortunately, the automaton was not capable of doing this (the first machine to win a chess game was Deep Blue in 1996). Kempelen's Turk
        was simply an elaborate mechanism in which one could hide an extremely talented chess player, who operated the automaton from inside.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        While the Turk may have been Kempelen's most famous invention, his other, lesser-known, invention around two decades later was not a hoax,
        and in fact is argued to be the world's first speech synthesiser. Writing first in German (1789) and then in French (1792), Kempelen documented
        his (sometimes presciently correct, sometimes incredibly incorrect) observations on the production of human speech, followed by his attempts
        to replicate that using the materials he could find. Expect Enlightenment polymathy, intricate hand-etchings by the author, and a retelling of
        the one time he tried to steal a set of bagpipes from an unsuspecting peasant.

        The translation by Shushan Teager represents the first translation of the French edition of this book. Edited by myself, Rivka Hyland, and Dr
        Bert Vaux, it was published by <a href="https://wipfandstock.com/"><b>Wipf and Stock</b></a> in 2022, and is available for purchase at

    <h2 class="display-5">Say It In Abkhaz</h2>
    <p class="body-text">
        Abkhazia, officially the Republic of Abkhazia, is a partially-recognised region in Georgia. In the mid-19th Century, thousands of Abkhaz were
        exiled to Turkey after resisting the Circassian genocide at the hands of the Russians, which killed over a million people. Although Turkey is
        home to the largest Abkhaz diaspora in the world, numbering over 100,000, the Cwyzhy dialect of Abkhaz has unfortunately gone with the death
        of its final speaker. This book, begun some 25 years ago, marks the last possible effort to compile and document it. With 25 years of work come
        25 years of versions, some predating full Unicode support in Microsoft Word, meaning that the compilation effort, and the subsequent decision-making
        around which transcriptions, vocabulary, etc. to keep, is difficult. However, this project is equally rewarding, given the long and painful history
        of the Abkhaz peoples, and the recent death of the Cwyzhy dialect.
